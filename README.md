## About

This is a collection of software curated by the [Florey institute](http://www.floreyinstitute.com/) at The University of Sheffield for analysing microbial genomes. The software is collected in a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container that can be run locally on any machine (e.g. Mac OSX, Windows) for testing purposes, or on a HPC environment (via singularity) for large-scale analysis.

## Software

## Usage

### Local

To run the software on your own machine, you will first need to install the *docker* container management system. Here is a [short overview of Docker](https://markdunning.github.io/docker-overview/) for those not familiar. The links below can be used to download Docker for Mac and Windows

- https://www.docker.com/docker-mac
- https://www.docker.com/docker-windows

Once docker is setup, you can run the following command in a terminal to run the container

```
docker run --rm -it markdunning/microbial-pipeline
```

You should then notice that the command prompt has changed to reflect the fact that you are inside the *home* directory of the container. You should now be able to run any of the software installed in the container

e.g.

```
samtools
```

You can leave the container by typing ```exit```

By default the container is isolated from your own machine. However, you can *mount* particular directories so they are accessible by adding the `-v` argument. If your `fastq` files are in a directory called `/PATH/TO/MY/DATA` you can map this to a directory called `data` using the following

```
docker run --rm -it -v /PATH/TO/MY/DATA/:/data markdunning/microbial-pipeline
```

You could then run any of included tools on your data by supplying the path `/data` to any tool. e.g.

```
fastqc /data/*
```
